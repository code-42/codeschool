6.3 Client socket.io Setup 250 pts

In our html file, load the socket.io.js script and connect to the socket.io server.

Load the socket.io.js script. The socket.io.js path you should use is '/socket.io/socket.io.js'. 
Express knows to serve the socket.io client js for this path.

Using the global io object that's now available for us, 
connect to the socket.io server at http://localhost:8080.
-->

<script src = '/socket.io/socket.io.js'></script>
<script>
  // use the socket.io server to connect to localhost:8080 here
  var socket = io.connect('http://localhost:8080');
</script>

6.4 Listening For Questions 240 pts

In our client below, listen for 'question' events from the server 
and call the insertQuestion function whenever the event fires.
First, listen for 'question' events from the server.

Now, have the event callback function call the insertQuestion function. 
The insertQuestion function is already created for you, and it's placed 
in its own file. It expects exactly one argument - the question.

-->
<script src="/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>
<script src="/insertQuestion.js"></script>

<script>
  var server = io.connect('http://localhost:8080');

  // Insert code here
  server.on('question', function(question){
     insertQuestion(question);
  });        
</script>
